They protect the roof insulation even better than a gravel embankment and they extend its life. Thanks to reduced charges for drainage of rainwater, it is possible to save money in many cities that have charges divided into water and sewage. Urban plans increasingly support or at least acknowledge greening of roofs as a compensation measure. This creates valuable biotopes.",
      "text2": "With each green roof, a new living space is created. Intensive greening with areas of grass and plants, areas for paths and rest can be created and used as a garden. On the other hand, extensive greening is created with plants that are not demanding and mainly low-growing, and are meant to be walkable only for control and care. Both forms of greening create valuable and interesting alternative biotopes for plants and microorganisms. They return something to nature from what was lost due to the construction.",

        "text1": "The goal of extensive greening is a naturally based vegetation with low load on the area and minimal care. The plants used to create the vegetation are often sedums. It is also supplemented with drought-resistant herbs. Extensive greening requires minimal care. In the first year or two, before the plants cover the whole surface of the roof, it is necessary to occasionally remove any invasive weeds. Sometimes also to fertilize with slow-dissolving fertilizer, depending on the type of substrate used. Sometimes it is necessary to supplement dead plants after winter etc.",
        "title2": "Intensive green roofs",
        "text2": "Intensive greening provides a wide range of possibilities for creating and using it as a garden on the roof. It is possible to create recreational areas and plant trees. With proper dimensioning of the vegetation support layer, proper watering and fertilization, the conditions for growth of plants on the roof are almost as good as in the ground. It is necessary to pay attention, for example, to the stability of trees and possible negative effects of the building, such as sunlit facades. The design of intensive greening and especially the selection of plants according to the object requires appropriate professional knowledge. For dimensioning the greening support layer, simple formulas can be used, namely „height of growth/10 = thickness of the substrate layer“. Grass and soil-covering plants need at least 20 cm of substrate. Even with large water storage capacity of substrates, intensive greening and especially grass must be regularly watered during the dry period. As with any garden near a home, there is also a direct relationship between the condition of the vegetation and the care for it."

For intensive greening, at least 300 kg/m² of surface load should be calculated according to the proposed substrate thickness. For extensive greening, the load is about 150 kg/m² in the saturated state of water. This applies to the use of substrates. Today, mineral mats can also be used, which significantly reduces the load to about 50 kg/m². To this load, always add the snow load for the given location."

Slopes up to 15° are usually not necessary to secure against landslides. For larger slopes, it is necessary to secure the substrate against sliding. The greater the slope, the more fixing elements must be used. This must be solved individually for each roof. Fixing is generally performed either using the lower edge of the roof, fixing over the ridge of the roof, fixing in the roof area, or a combination of these types."
